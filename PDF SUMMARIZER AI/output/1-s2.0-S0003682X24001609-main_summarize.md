The proposed Least Mean Square-Fourth (LMS/F) adaptive algorithm effectively removes ocular artifacts from EEG signals, with a relative root mean square error reduction of up to 90%. The LMS/F algorithm outperforms traditional approaches, such as Least Mean Fourth and combined step size normalized least Mean Square adaptive algorithm, in terms of convergence speed and steady-state performance. With a filter length of M, the algorithm achieves a mean square deviation (MSD) analysis, demonstrating its superiority. So what? The LMS/F algorithm's ability to eliminate ocular artifacts without requiring calibration trials or preprocessing techniques makes it a valuable tool for real-time EEG signal processing applications, such as brain-computer interfaces.
